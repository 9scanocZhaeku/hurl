Game of Thrones is one of the most popular and acclaimed TV shows of all time, based on the fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin. The show features a complex plot, a large cast of characters, stunning visuals, and epic battles. But if you want to watch or rewatch the third season of Game of Thrones, which resolution should you choose: 480p or 720p?
 
480p is a standard definition resolution that has a width of 480 pixels and a height of 270 pixels. It is suitable for smaller screens, such as smartphones or tablets, or if you have a limited internet bandwidth. However, 480p also has some drawbacks, such as lower image quality, less detail, and more pixelation. You might miss some of the finer details of the show, such as the costumes, the scenery, or the facial expressions.

720p is a high definition resolution that has a width of 1280 pixels and a height of 720 pixels. It is suitable for larger screens, such as laptops or TVs, or if you have a good internet connection. 720p offers better image quality, more detail, and less pixelation. You can enjoy the full beauty and spectacle of the show, such as the dragons, the White Walkers, or the Red Wedding.
 
So which resolution should you watch? It depends on your personal preference, your device, and your internet speed. If you don't mind sacrificing some quality for convenience or saving data, then 480p might be enough for you. But if you want to experience the show in its full glory and immerse yourself in the world of Westeros, then 720p is definitely worth it.
